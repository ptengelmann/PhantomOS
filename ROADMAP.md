# PhantomOS Roadmap

## Our Mission

**Build the definitive IP Asset Graph for gaming merchandise.**

Every product-to-character mapping makes our platform smarter. Every publisher who connects their store expands our proprietary database. This compounds into an unassailable moat.

---

## Phase 1: Intelligence Platform (CURRENT FOCUS)

**Status: MVP Complete, Pilot Active**

This is our core product and the foundation of everything else. We are 100% focused here until we achieve product-market fit.

### Why This Phase Matters

The IP Asset Graph is our moat. Phase 1 is entirely about:
1. **Accumulating mappings** — Every product tagged to a character grows our data asset
2. **Proving value** — Show publishers insights they can't get anywhere else
3. **Building AI accuracy** — More data = better auto-tagging = faster onboarding

### Core Features (Complete)

| Feature | Status | Moat Impact |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **AI Asset Tagging** | Complete | PRIMARY — generates product-character mappings |
| **Fan Intelligence Hub** | Complete | Shows value of the IP Asset Graph |
| **Revenue Analytics** | Complete | Proves ROI, tracks by character |
| **Shopify Integration** | Complete | Ingests real product and sales data |
| **CSV Import** | Complete | Universal data onboarding |
| **Dashboard** | Complete | Daily engagement driver |
| **Team Management** | Complete | Multi-user = stickier accounts |
| **RBAC** | Complete | Enterprise-ready security |

### Current Priorities (Next 90 Days)

| Priority | Goal | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Pilot expansion** | 10 → 25 publishers | More data = better AI |
| **AI tagging accuracy** | 75% → 85% | Faster onboarding |
| **Product mappings** | 5K → 25K | Core data asset growth |
| **Engagement metrics** | Weekly → Daily DAU | Prove retention |
| **Amazon connector** | Launch | Unlock largest channel |

### Success Metrics for Phase 1

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Publishers in pilot | 10 | 50 |
| Total product-asset mappings | 5,000 | 100,000 |
| AI tagging acceptance rate | 70% | 90% |
| Monthly active users | 25 | 200 |
| NPS score | — | 50+ |

**We will NOT move to Phase 2 until these metrics are hit.**

## Long-Term Vision

The following phases represent our product vision after achieving PMF with the Intelligence Platform. These are opportunities enabled by the IP Asset Graph — not near-term commitments.

### Phase 2: Advanced AI

**Unlock:** After 100K+ product mappings

| Feature | Enabled By |
|---------|------------|
| Image recognition tagging | Training data from human-verified mappings |
| Cross-publisher benchmarks | Network of publisher data |
| Demand forecasting | Historical sales × character patterns |
| Natural language queries | Structured IP Asset Graph |

### Phase 3: Additional Connectors

**Unlock:** After proving Shopify value

| Connector | Priority | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Amazon Seller Central | High | 40%+ of merch sales |
| Amazon Vendor Central | High | Large publisher standard |
| WooCommerce | Medium | Indie publisher preference |
| BigCommerce | Medium | Mid-market coverage |
| Etsy | Low | Niche/fan-made segment |

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features

**Unlock:** After landing first enterprise deal

| Feature | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| SSO/SAML | Enterprise IT requirements |
| Audit logging | Compliance needs |
| Custom reporting | Executive dashboards |
| API access | Integration with existing systems |
| Multi-region | Data residency requirements |

## Future Opportunities (Post-PMF)

These represent larger bets that build on top of the IP Asset Graph. Each is a potential company-sized opportunity. We will evaluate these **only after** the Intelligence Platform achieves PMF.

### Merch Studio

**AI-powered merchandise design generation**

Transform IP assets into merchandise designs using generative AI. Select a character, choose a product type, generate designs.

*Dependency: Requires robust IP asset library with imagery*

### Production

**Order routing and fulfillment orchestration**

Connect to print-on-demand (Printful, Printify) and manufacturers. Route orders based on cost, speed, quality.

*Dependency: Requires Merch Studio or external design source*

### Storefront

**Direct-to-consumer e-commerce**

Hosted storefronts at phantom.store/{publisher}. Full checkout, payments, order management.

*Dependency: Requires production or existing fulfillment*

### Creators

**Influencer partnership platform**

Match publishers with gaming creators. Revenue sharing, campaign management, performance tracking.

*Dependency: Requires storefront or significant publisher network*

## What We're NOT Building Right Now

To maintain focus, we are explicitly **not** pursuing:

- [ ] Merch design generation
- [ ] Print-on-demand integration
- [ ] E-commerce storefronts
- [ ] Creator marketplace
- [ ] WooCommerce/BigCommerce connectors
- [ ] White-label solutions

**These are all good ideas. They're just not the right ideas for today.**

---

## Decision Framework

When evaluating new features or opportunities:

1. **Does it grow the IP Asset Graph?** → Prioritize
2. **Does it improve AI tagging accuracy?** → Prioritize
3. **Does it drive publisher engagement?** → Consider
4. **Does it require the IP Asset Graph?** → Defer until graph is robust
5. **Is it a distraction from core focus?** → Reject

## The Bottom Line

**We are building one thing: the IP Asset Graph.**

Everything else — the dashboard, the AI, the integrations — exists to accumulate more product-to-character mappings. That data is our moat. It doesn't exist anywhere else. And every publisher who uses PhantomOS makes it more valuable.

The future phases are exciting. They're also dependent on building the best IP Asset Graph in the world first.

*Focus wins. Data compounds. The moat deepens.*
